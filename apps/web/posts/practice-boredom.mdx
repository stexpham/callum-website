title: Practice boredom
lede: Before you can generate new insights, you have to wander. How does one perform this wandering thing? Start by aimlessly doing nothing. In other words, practice boredom.

Today I want to describe _how to wander_, which is the first step in my "_[3 Ws](/wander-wonder-wunder)_" maxim for generating new insights. It may be a very small idea, but nothing generative happens without it. And as an example of how easy it is to forget this crucial step, I've not mentioned it once in any previous post so far. Such is the way fathoming where and how beginnings begin.

I've introduced a number of conceptual aphorisms in the past month of this blog that I'm refering to in this post. In a previous post, I described two basic prerequisites that kickstart any creative process: [_love and theft_](/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft). I also previously described how one might go about loving and thieving their way towards creativity, which I call the "_[3 Ws](/wander-wonder-wunder)_":

`Wander > Wonder > Wunder`

So then. To wander, just _practise boredom_.

`Practice boredom`

There you go. That's it. Entirely. It reminds me of Jon Kabat-Zinn saying "_where ever you go, there you are_" or "_simply return to the breathe_". It's stupid simple. It's obvious. And yet it's difficult to remember and it's difficult to put into practice.

As an aphorism, it's quite beautiful. It's a poster. It's a door mat. Beauty helps make things easier to remember (I'm going to argue soon for aesthetics as the primary mode of human comprehension).

## To practise boredom, do nothing.

So, how does one practice boredom? Simply, one _does nothing_. That is, avoid doing things. Avoid the low-hanging fruit, like daily routines, todo lists, being productive, coveting goals, having a TV show to watch, or making dinner. Don't be productive. Get some rest. Stare out the window. Stop talking.

When you do this, you can suddenly find yourself remembering things past, and connecting them to things seen today. Or suddenly discovering the logic of ants. That's wonder; fascinating interlinked connections will appear like invisible hyenas laughing at you from their hiding place.

I'll caution you to please not expect that your boring ideas will be amazing. Stop expecting things to happen. Stop. Just enjoy some boredom. Laugh back at the hyenas. A daemon will arise if it wishes.
