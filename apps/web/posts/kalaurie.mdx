I am drawn to art in all it's forms: from painting to poetry to film and music. What I did not really feel any affinity to, before working with [Kalaurie](https://www.kalaurie.com.au/), was fashion. But as you can see from her works, designing and building her website became an easy exercise is learning how to appreciate it.

I originally built the site in 2018, before Shopify had any robust API for Javascript web apps. This year (2024), I rebuilt it using Shopify's new [Hydrogen system](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/) and [Remix web framework](https://remix.run/), which was a pleasure to work with. The result is a much more performant experience.

On the Collections page, I simply allowed Vlad Savin's excellent photography to take centre stage.

My favourite part of the site is the contact page. Sometimes forms can be quite boring, so I choose to extend the faux artisinal copy language—as though the website had a speaking part in "The Age of Innocence"—to create a contact page with attitude. The bold typography does the rest.

Not every page stuck to the "hero then cards" formula. That would quickly become habitual, and may lead to losing user attention. So I used alternative graphic layouts on the quieter, information-driven pages.
