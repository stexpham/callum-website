Brand and website design and build for Aquiba, who designed and built smart water meters in Australia for Australian conditions. The crossover of long-lasting IOT hardware with consumer and administration systems was fascinating to learn about, and design for. Much needed local technology knowhow in the age of climate change.

Unfortunately, Aquiba was a victim of the Covid economic downturn, closing down shortly before the brand and website work went live.
